### Hello Vue ###
At the core Vue allows us to render data to the dom using a a template syntax.

If you look at the example it seems very similar to rendering template. Though you will notice that Vue has done a lot of the work for us under the hood. If you were to change the data `message` you would see the rendered example update.
